My first try at an HTML5 game without images, strictly HTML and JavaScript.

So, this game, has no images, no sounds too (I wasn't too sure how to do sound withou adding an audio file).  I love creating games particularly on HTML5 canvas, so I decided to take up this challenge.  This competition, is my first try at a smallest, minified HTML5 game.

Rules (Simple...)
Just hit the play and start, avoid all those ice falling up and down (in keeping with the "Reversed" topic of this competition).  And goal of the game is to reach the door.
